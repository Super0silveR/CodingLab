So far as I understand, C++ needs a text editor and a compiler and we will use GCC as a compiler and VS code as editor (or just IDE)

Well turns out my first problem is with my include : #include <iostream>
with error : "#include errors detected. Please update your includePath. Squiggles are disabled for this translation unit"

In order to fix this, I will follow a tutorial to install everything correctly
